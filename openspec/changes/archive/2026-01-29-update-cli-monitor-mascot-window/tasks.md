## 1. Implementation
- [x] Add mascot asset folder and CC0 source note under `public/mascot/`.
- [x] Update monitor window creation options for transparent, pet-style sizing, and taskbar behavior.
- [x] Add expand/collapse logic and click-to-expand interaction in `MonitorWindow`.
- [x] Restyle monitor window to mascot + speech bubble layout with motion-reduced fallback.
- [x] Update monitor window permissions if additional window APIs are required.

## 2. Quality
- [ ] Verify monitor window still opens/closes with existing settings toggle.
- [ ] Verify click-to-expand works and does not block dragging.
